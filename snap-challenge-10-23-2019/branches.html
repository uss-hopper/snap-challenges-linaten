<h>How to use these classes</h>
<P>
	While working on a project, the first level of commit that should be used is the feature branch. When wanting to upload a file or a change to a file, the first thing to dop is to use git to checkout dev. The second is to git pull down from the server to ensure that the most recent updates have been completed. Then, you would use git checkout -b to upload. Next, you should use git to merge the files. Next, you will use git checkout again to move it up to the second to the last level.Then once again you should pull to ensrue that there has been no further changes. Then, you will need to merge again.
